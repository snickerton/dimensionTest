	Hello friendly website trawler,

		In case you were wondering, "does this weird asian kid actually know how to code a
		smooth and dynamic website or did he just completely copy an HTML5 UP template?"

		The answer is ... yeah sorta.

		Yes I could write (albeit quite slowly) this beautiful website from scratch. And in fact,
		if you compare my site to the original, you'll find I've made A LOT improvements ranging
		from loading performance to cosmetics.

		However does this mean I didn't liberally borrow a template for my website?
		Nope.

		So take from it what you will about my HTML/CSS skills. If anything, I've at least proven
		that I can write an informative and understandable comment, which as we all know, is somehow
		the most lacking thing about a dev when you're working with them.

		Enjoy Life,
		Tony

<!-- The following was a joke placeholder for the "Intro" section -->

<!--
&lt;This website is still under construction.&gt;
<br>
Please do not take the following article seriously but rather as an indication of how terrible my humor is.
</p>
<p>
	Let's talk about sharks.
	<br> <br>
	It is a well known fact that sharks can live up to 25 years in the wild, however did you know that the during that
	time of living, sharks only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period?
	<br> <br>
	Did you know that sharks make no sound, not because they can't, but because they choose not to?
	<br> <br>
	Did you know that sharks only need to drink water once every couple of days? They recieve most of their needed liquids from
	their consistent diet!
	<br> <br>
	Did you know that female sharks can become pregnant at 5 years old?
	<br> <br>
	Finally, did you know that a shark's jugular veins contain a series of one way vales that prevent excess blood flow to the brain
	when they lower their head to take a drink of water?
	<br> <br>
	....wait a minute.
	<br> <br>
	Shit, these are giraffe facts.
	<br>
	<br>
	Well then, moving along. This following paragraph is to test exactly how my website handles longer, less rapid fire, blocks of text which
	may or may not end up devolving into a Faulkner-like passage of run-on sentences and streams of consciousness that doesn't even prove anything
	about the writer besides how juvenile his writing mind still is and how much his Google calendar clearly lacks basic-human-interaction-related appointments
	that would allow him to understand what actually causes the heightened release of endorphins in the brain (thereby causing laughter) in what we call <i> a joke </i> and furthermore,
	to speak more colloquially and directly to the reader as if he or she was my only friend:
	has he never heard of lorem ipsum?? like people call Latin a dead language but holy shit does it consistenly nail its job as a text placeholder which generates sentences
	no one can understand because... oh wait I guess Latin really is a dead language that ends up completely wasting the time of every ambitious high school scholar
	or horribly mistaken slacker who thinks that Latin will help teach him the prefixes that show up on the SAT. I mean not to project or anything but that kind of guy must really be
	stupid and probably mistakes giraffes for sharks on a daily basis and then goes on to make what he thinks are clever self deprecating jokes that, to be honest, are never going
	to be seen by anyone in the entire world because life is too short and we're all going to die.
